Problem Statement- Find publicly available data for key factors that influence US home prices nationally.Then,
build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20
years. Use the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices

Introduction- The US has the largest asset market in residential real estate. The United States' inventory scale for residential real estate reached 39.3 trillion dollars, or roughly 31% of the country's total assets, according to the Federal Reserve's Financial Stability Report. Equity assets came in second with 37.2 trillion dollars, or 29% of the total.
The majority of US assets are made up of residential real estate, and the US securities market is heavily dependent on financial products like MBS that are derived from real estate. Additionally, a sizable amount of the assets and debts held by residents are allocated to real estate. As a result, the subject of estate market analysis has always been crucial.


Factors taken into consideration that effect home prices in United States are:

1. Per Capita GDP
2. Employment Rate
3. Unemployment Rate
4. Interest Rate
5. Construction Price Index
6. Working Age Population
7. Income
8. New Constructed Units

A stand-in for house prices is the S&P CASE-SHILLER Index.
